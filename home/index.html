<P> ELEVATOR PITCH: Remember when you were a wide-eyed freshman bewildered about all the academic opportunities Princeton had to offer? We do to. Enter Plan Princeton, a web application where students can plan out courses they would like to take during their Princeton career. Our goal is two fold: One, to help students of all years explore their wide range of academic interests and the potential courses that they would need to fulfill these interests. Two, to assist residential colleges Peer Academic Advisors (PAAs) and students department-assigned faculty advisors in giving advice to first and second year undergraduates. Plan Princeton allows students to visualize potential course schedules that will fulfill their concentrations. So rather than scouring multiple departments websites looking for prerequisites and departmentals, students can find all of this information consolidated onto one single webpage. Now, with this application, students can create their individualized Princeton road maps to guide their own paths to graduation.
